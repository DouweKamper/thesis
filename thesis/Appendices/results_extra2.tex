\caption{Pair plots (with a kernel density style) for all calibrated parameters of Model 2. The presented data is from 5 ensembles (last 1000 steps of each chain), run with DE, an uninformative prior and 1 observation for evaluating the likelihood. The parameters as presented here are transformed for MCMC.}\label{fig_kde_model2_DE}
